# Physica Finance ‚Äì Indexing API

Welcome to the open-source **Indexing API** for Physica Finance, a robust backend solution designed to fetch, analyze, and serve decentralized swap data across multiple EVM-compatible blockchains. This API is built with Express.js and Supabase and supports real-time data queries for analytics, token volumes, user activity, and more.

---

## üìå Features

- üîó Multi-chain support (chains defined in `/config/chain`)
- üìä Top tokens by volume (daily, weekly, monthly)
- üë• Top users by swap volume
- üîÑ Latest swap activity
- üîç Query swaps by chain
- üíé Token-specific user volume insights

---

## üì° API Endpoints

### `GET /chains`

````

---

### `GET /:chainId/swaps?limit=100&offset=0`

Returns recent swaps for a specific chain ID.

---

### `GET /top-tokens-all-chains`

Returns the top 5 tokens by volume across all chains for `daily`, `weekly`, and `monthly` periods.

---

### `GET /latest-swaps?limit=10`

Returns the latest global swap activity across all chains.

---

### `GET /:chainId/top-tokens`

Returns top 3 tokens by volume for the selected chain in the last `day`, `week`, and `month`.

---

### `GET /:chainId/top-users`

Returns top 10 users by swap volume on a given chain.

## üõ† Adding Tokens for Indexing

To include a new token in the indexing process, you need to register it under the appropriate chain configuration file located in:

```

/config/tokens/<chain>.js

````

### üîß Steps to Add a Token

1. **Open the appropriate chain file**, e.g., `config/tokens/planq.json` or `config/tokens/planq.json`.

2. **Add the token object** with the required information:
### add tokens on chains
```js
{
  ....
  "tokens": [
    {
      "address": "0x5EBCdf1De1781e8B5D41c016B0574aD53E2F6E1A",
      "symbol": "WPLANQ",
      "decimals": 18
    },
  ]
}
````

### üìò adding Chains


```js
planq: {
    chainId: 7070,
    name: 'Planq',
    rpcUrl: process.env.PLANQ_RPC_URL,
    factoryAddress: process.env.PLANQ_FACTORY_ADDRESS || '',
    tokenListPath: path.join(__dirname, 'tokens/planq.json'),
    knownRouters: [
      '0xasdsad', // Universal Router address
    ],
    fromBlock: 14859328,
  },
```

> ‚úÖ `fromBlock` defines from which block the indexer begins fetching swap data for that token, ensuring faster and efficient syncing.
> ‚úÖ `knownRouters` Known router defines for set known Universal Address if you have more Universal Router just add as Array.
> ‚úÖ `factoryAddress` Defines as Fatory Contract v3 work both for uniswap and physcia Finance
